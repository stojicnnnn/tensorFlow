Setting up SAM and issues faced:

A Guide to Deploying a Dockerized AI Project on Windows with WSL 2
Date: June 20, 2025
Goal: To successfully run a complex, GPU-accelerated AI application (SAM2 + Grounding DINO) distributed as a Docker project on a Windows machine.

Introduction
This document outlines the series of challenges encountered and the solutions applied to successfully deploy a Linux-based Docker application on Windows 10/11. This journey highlights common pitfalls related to system setup, permissions, resource allocation, and networking in a modern development environment using the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL 2).

Issue #1: Running Linux Scripts on Windows
Problem: Attempting to run the ./deploy command directly in the Windows Command Prompt (cmd.exe) resulted in the error: '.' is not recognized as an internal or external command.
Diagnosis: The command and the script (./deploy) were designed for a Linux/Unix environment (like Bash shell), not for the Windows Command Prompt.
Solution: The entire project must be run from within a Linux environment installed on Windows. This led to the requirement for the Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL).
Issue #2: Setting Up the Linux Environment (WSL)
Problem: A suitable Linux environment was not installed. The initial installation attempt was stuck or corrupted.
Diagnosis: The Ubuntu WSL instance was not starting correctly, presenting a black, unresponsive terminal screen. A subsequent installation attempt was stuck at 0% download, indicating a network or system state issue.
Solution: A full, clean re-installation was performed:
We forced a shutdown of any stuck WSL processes using PowerShell: wsl --shutdown.
We completely removed the corrupted installation: wsl --unregister Ubuntu.
We performed a full system reboot to clear any transient system or network errors.
We reinstalled Ubuntu cleanly using PowerShell: wsl --install -d Ubuntu.
Issue #3: User Permissions in the New Linux Environment
Problem: After a fresh install, the user could not remember the password for their new Ubuntu user account, preventing the use of sudo for administrative tasks.
Diagnosis: Forgotten user credentials.
Solution: We used a WSL-specific feature to reset the password:
From Windows PowerShell, logged into Ubuntu as the super-user: wsl --user root.
From the root shell, changed the password for the nikola user: passwd nikola.
Issue #4: Docker Integration with WSL
Problem: Commands inside the deploy script were failing with the error: The command 'docker' could not be found in this WSL 2 distro.
Diagnosis: Docker Desktop was running on Windows, but the necessary connection to the new Ubuntu environment (WSL 2) was not enabled.
Solution: We enabled the WSL Integration within the Docker Desktop application:
Opened Docker Desktop Settings > Resources > WSL Integration.
Toggled the switch for "Ubuntu" OFF, clicked "Apply & Restart".
Toggled the switch for "Ubuntu" back ON, clicked "Apply & Restart". This "off-and-on" cycle forced a clean refresh of the connection.
Issue #5: Docker Permissions
Problem: After fixing the integration, Docker commands failed with: permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket.
Diagnosis: This is a standard Linux security feature. By default, a regular user does not have permission to control the Docker service.
Solution: We added the user to the docker group:
Ran the command: sudo usermod -aG docker $USER.
Crucially, we closed the Ubuntu terminal and opened a new one for the group membership change to take effect.
Issue #6: System Resource Exhaustion during Docker Build
Problem: The docker build process ran almost to completion but crashed at the final "exporting to image" stage with a SIGBUS: bus error and a subsequent Input/output error.
Diagnosis: This low-level system error indicated the computer was running out of resourcesâ€”either Memory (RAM) or Disk Space. A check with df -h confirmed the Windows C: drive was 94% full.
Solution:
Disk Space: The primary solution was to free up a significant amount of space on the Windows C: drive by deleting old files, uninstalling programs, and using the Disk Cleanup utility.
Memory: As a best practice, we also created a .wslconfig file in the Windows user profile folder (C:\Users\Nikola) to explicitly grant WSL more memory, preventing future RAM issues. The file contained:
Ini, TOML

[wsl2]
memory=12GB
swap=16GB
A full restart (wsl --shutdown and restarting Docker Desktop) was performed to apply all changes.
Issue #7: Docker Container Configuration and Networking
Problem #1: After the image was built, the container would start, but the application inside would crash with RuntimeError: Found no NVIDIA driver on your system.

Diagnosis: The docker run command in the deploy script was missing the flag to grant the container access to the host's GPU.
Solution: We edited the deploy script to add the --gpus all flag to the docker run command.
Problem #2: The service was running inside the container, confirmed by the logs (Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8090), but was inaccessible from the web browser (ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED).

Diagnosis: The container's network port was not exposed to the Windows host machine.
Solution: We edited the deploy script again to add the port mapping flag -p 8090:8090 to the docker run command. This connected port 8090 on the host to port 8090 in the container.
Issue #8: Sharing the Service with Others
Problem: The user wanted to share the http://localhost:8090 URL with a friend.
Diagnosis: localhost only works on the machine where the server is running. It is not accessible over the internet.
Solution: Instead of a complex and insecure port forwarding setup, the recommended solution was to use a tunneling service.
We used ngrok to create a secure, temporary public URL.
The command .\ngrok.exe http 8090 was run on Windows to create a public link that forwards to localhost:8090, which could then be safely shared.
